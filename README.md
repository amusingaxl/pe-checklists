# Protocol Engineering Checklists

## Rationale
>The following checklists are meant to be used as a co-pilot for protocol engineers to ensure consistency throughout the development workflow.  
>They emerged during reviews and crafting as a way to avoid pitfalls and allow protocol engineers to focus on more in-depth reviews and workflow improvements that will be reflected ideally in these checklists.  
>These checklists are a work in progress, continuing evelolving and refined on the go, and not meant to be comprehensive or intended as a  developer guide (for that please refers to [developerguides](https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides) and [Maker Protocol 101](https://docs.makerdao.com/getting-started/maker-protocol-101)).
